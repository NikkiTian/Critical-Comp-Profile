At first I thought this was a very abstract assignment and it bothered me in finding the right "clock". Then I noticed the assignment description and started working on the word game specifically focuses on the phrace "tracking time". What if the user is literally tracking the time? So this was my initial idea. Going towards the social context, people are actively chasing time and our perception of time is becoming clearer. We constantly check the time to see if we're missing anything out.
But the more we check the time the more accumulated is this image, eventually we could find so hard to see the next number that we "lost track of time".
This generator is also a diagram directly showing the path of increasing time, that I find it looks like a web interpreting the complex relationship between people, people and time.
This is truly an unconventional clock to me, and I really like the puns of the title and action.
