    <p>From what I see the description is clear and it would be easy to picture it. Kasa only gave some degrees of detailed instruction, for instance, stroke weight and the angle of the objects towards the camera; allowing me to have space creating my own. I’m also exciting to create the meandering spilled water outside of the canvas.
      First I drew a mini sketch to match with her description and insured the layout. A milk box on the left and a tilted cup on the right with spilled milk. I added a table behind to complete the setting. For the extended spilled water, I create a canvas within a canvas and let the water drip down from the table, eventually reaching the outside of the canvas. Then everything else is self-explanatory.
      One thing new tot me is creating the curve lines on my picture. Referencing from ChatGPT, I learned the action curveVertext() will allow me to plot out the dots and draw smooth lines between. This played an important role in creating the water part.
      The only thing not so clear is the color. Kasa told me to do whatever I want, so I chose a light color expressing a vibrant mood. I also change the color of milk into a greenish-blue color because I felt it suits in my color palette more (and Kasa didn’t told me to not do so). However, the spilled milk reminds me of the quote “don’t cry over the spilled milk”, which actually hints me a sad, melancholy atmosphere. However, whatever has to be done is done. If I had a second chance I’ll definitely change my overall tone.
