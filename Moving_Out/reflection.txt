My game focuses on creating a nostalgic scene where the character revisists their old apartment that is soon to be taken down by the government. Three scenes - downstairs, bedroom, desk view - appears sequentially and fragments of memory will be discovered through interacting with the obejcts.
The very first grey-boxing assignment alloweed me to practice the very basic (but the most crutial) interaction such as dialogue showing and click and switch scene. Later I wrote a whole game flow to determine the elements I want to showcase (seen ideas.txt), and started working on it along the way. Most assets are found images with customized filter. I referenced the other faculty Luca's gaming structure that he puts every content of a scene as one function below and organize them in draw through case switching.
My game is definitely not in its complete form, as there're still a lot of features that I didn't have time to fulfill them all; but meanwhile I'm also rest assured that we didn't got so much time otherwise the content will infinitely grow and my computer will crash. One thing I'll change is the initiation of my minesweeper game; that I still find trouble jumping back and forth between scrips (it keeps showing the loading page) so I just copy the link of two scripts under console.log - which turns out to be quite amusing/meta. But still it wasn't what I planned to do.
Making a game through p5 is really hard that I have to work everything in backend, that every little adjustment can be work on for ages. Luckily I'm only making a point/click game, so eventually, thanks to Ally's help (very), I got to finish this game on the last day.My code is quite redundant and there're absolutely more easier, clearer way of doing what I did (e.g. I used a thousand way determining whether mouse is clicked); but here's all I've got.
